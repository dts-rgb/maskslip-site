    <h1>Privacy</h1>
    <p class="intro">Your videos are yours. We built Maskslip to watch the moments, not the people behind them.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <p>When you create an account, we store the basics: your Apple ID identifier and the account info Apple shares during Sign in with Apple (name and email, if you choose to share them). We also store your purchase and credit history so you can pick up where you left off.</p>
      <p>When you analyze a video, the video file is temporarily uploaded to our servers so our pipeline can process it. The annotations and summary we generate are saved to your account so you can revisit them later.</p>
      <p>We collect basic usage analytics -- things like app launches, feature usage, and crash reports -- to understand what's working and what isn't. None of this is tied to your identity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How your video is processed</h2>
      <p>This is the important one. When you submit a video for analysis, it's uploaded to our secure servers and then sent to Google's Gemini AI for processing. Gemini watches the video and returns text observations -- things like "lip compression at 0:14" or "gaze shift at 0:32." That's it. Text in, text out.</p>
      <p>We do not extract biometric data. No faceprints, no facial geometry, no identity mapping. Maskslip observes behavior in video the same way you would -- it just writes down what it notices.</p>
      <p>Google processes the video under their API terms, which means it is not used to train their models. The video file is deleted from Google's servers after processing completes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How we use your information</h2>
      <p>Three reasons, nothing else: (1) to deliver the service you're using, (2) to improve the app, and (3) if the law requires it. We don't sell your data. We don't use it for advertising. We don't build profiles to target you with anything.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
      <p>We rely on a small number of services to run Maskslip:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supabase</strong> -- authentication, database, and file storage. Your account data and videos live here.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini</strong> -- AI video analysis. Your video is sent to Gemini for processing and deleted after.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> -- subscription and credit management. Handles your purchase history.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple</strong> -- Sign in with Apple for authentication, App Store for payments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each service has its own privacy policy. We chose them because they don't use your data for advertising or model training.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How we protect it</h2>
      <p>All data is transmitted over HTTPS. Videos are stored in private, encrypted storage scoped to your account -- no one else can access them. Your authentication is handled through Apple's secure sign-in infrastructure. API keys and secrets are stored server-side, never on your device.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>Your analysis history stays in your account until you delete it. You can remove individual analyses anytime from the History screen, which deletes both the stored video and the annotations. If you delete your account, all associated data is removed from our servers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your data, your control</h2>
      <p>You can delete any analysis from your history at any time. If you want a full copy of your data or want everything wiped, email us and we'll handle it within 30 days.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Entertainment, not diagnosis</h2>
      <p>Maskslip is an entertainment app. It surfaces behavioral observations for fun -- not for hiring decisions, legal proceedings, relationship judgments, or any form of assessment. The observations are generated by AI and are not scientifically validated. Please don't use them to make real-world decisions about real people.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Age</h2>
      <p>Maskslip is available to users aged 12 and older. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 12. If you believe a child under 12 has created an account, contact us and we'll remove it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>If we make significant changes to this policy, we'll let you know at least 30 days in advance through the app or by email.</p>
