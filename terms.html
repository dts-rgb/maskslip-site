    <h1>Terms of use</h1>
    <p class="intro">The short version: use MaskSlip for fun, not for judging people.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Acceptance of terms</h2>
      <p>By downloading, installing, or using MaskSlip, you agree to these terms of use. If you don't agree, don't use the app. It's that simple.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What the app does</h2>
      <p>MaskSlip analyzes video for visible behavioral signals: facial expressions, gestures, gaze patterns, blink rate, and posture. It returns timestamped text observations describing what it sees.</p>
      <p>That's all it does. MaskSlip is not a lie detector. It is not a diagnostic tool. It is not a scientific instrument. It is an entertainment app that watches video and writes down what it notices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Entertainment only</h2>
      <p>This is the part that matters most. MaskSlip's output is for entertainment purposes only.</p>
      <p>The observations are automated commentary on visible behavior generated by an AI model. They are not factual determinations about any person. They are not scientifically validated. They carry no evidentiary, diagnostic, or predictive value whatsoever.</p>
      <p>Do not use MaskSlip's output to make decisions about any person's honesty, character, mental state, emotional condition, or fitness for anything. The app does not and cannot tell you whether someone is lying, hiding something, or thinking a particular thought. Treat the results the way you'd treat a horoscope: fun to read, not something to act on.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your content</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for any video you upload to or record within MaskSlip. By submitting a video for analysis, you represent that you have the legal right to upload and process it.</p>
      <p>MaskSlip does not verify the source of your videos. We cannot and do not determine whether you have consent from the people appearing in them. If a video violates someone's rights or breaks any law, that responsibility is yours.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>No biometric data collection</h2>
      <p>MaskSlip does not collect, store, or process biometric identifiers. It does not create faceprints, facial geometry maps, or identification templates. It does not perform facial recognition.</p>
      <p>What it does: sends your video to an AI model that watches the footage and returns plain text descriptions of visible behavior. Text in, text out. No biometric data is extracted at any point in the process.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Subscriptions and credits</h2>
      <p>MaskSlip uses a credit system. Each analysis consumes credits. You receive free credits when you sign up, and you can purchase more through in-app subscriptions.</p>
      <p>All purchases are processed through Apple. Subscriptions auto-renew until you cancel them through your Apple ID settings (Settings > your name > Subscriptions). Refunds follow Apple's standard refund policy and are handled entirely by Apple.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>Don't use MaskSlip to harass, stalk, bully, or defame anyone. Don't use the output as evidence of wrongdoing, dishonesty, or guilt. Don't present the results as scientific fact, expert analysis, or proof of anything.</p>
      <p>Don't use MaskSlip to analyze videos of minors. Don't use it in any way that violates the law in your jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>If you violate these rules, we can suspend or terminate your account without notice.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>MaskSlip is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of accuracy, reliability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>
      <p>We do not guarantee that the AI observations are accurate, complete, or meaningful. We are not liable for any decisions, actions, or consequences that result from your use of the app or its output. You use MaskSlip at your own risk.</p>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, MaskSlip and its creators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the app.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to these terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll notify you through the app or by email. Continued use of MaskSlip after changes take effect constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
